Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a process of coming up with a software



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.strucured programming-of 1970 this one improved code clarity,development and maintenance
2.object oriented-of 1980 this one emphasize on modularity,reusabilty and abstraction
3.agile methodologies of 2000- focuses on iterative, collaborative, flexibible development pocess to adapt changes

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirement Analysis: Define project goals and gather requirements.
2. Planning: Create a project plan with timelines and resources.
3. Design: Outline the software architecture and design components.
4. Implementation: Write the code following the design.
5. Testing: Test the software to identify and fix issues.
6. Deployment: Release the software to the production environment.
7. Maintenance: Monitor and update the software as needed.
8. Review and Feedback: Collect feedback and improve the process.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
